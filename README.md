## 📌 Project Title

**Insurance Fraud Detection System Using ETL and Graph Database**

---

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to detect potential insurance fraud by integrating data from various insurance companies into a **Neo4j graph database** using an **ETL pipeline** (e.g., with Pentaho or Talend). It models complex relationships between individuals, claims, vehicles, and contracts to uncover suspicious patterns and fraud networks.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Extract data from multiple formats (CSV, JSON, APIs)
* Clean and normalize the data
* Model entities and relationships as graph nodes and edges
* Load structured data into Neo4j
* Analyze fraud patterns and suspicious links
* Visualize relationships through a front-end interface (planned)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **ETL Tool:** Pentaho / Talend
* **Database:** Neo4j
* **Language:** Java / Python / Cypher
* **Others:** CSV, JSON, REST APIs

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Neo4j Desktop or AuraDB
* ETL Tool (Pentaho or Talend)
* Java or Python environment
* Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. 
3. Set up Neo4j and create a database

4. Open the ETL tool and load the provided transformation job

5. Run the ETL job to extract, clean, and load data into Neo4j

---

## 🧪 Usage

* Use Cypher queries to explore entities and relationships
* Search for fraud patterns (e.g., individuals connected to multiple suspicious claims)
* Visualize graph data using Neo4j Bloom or custom React interface (if available)
